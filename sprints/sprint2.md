## üìä Success Metrics
- **Template Adoption**: 70% of new projects use templates
- **Structure Quality**: Stories created with templates have 40% fewer structural gaps
- **User Confidence**: New user completion rate increases by 35%
- **Suggestion Acceptance**: 50% of suggested plot points are accepted

---

## üö® Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Templates feel restrictive to creative writers
  - **Mitigation**: Always provide "blank" option, make templates customizable
- **Risk**: Suggestions feel like "writing by committee"
  - **Mitigation**: Frame as inspiration, not requirements; allow dismissal
- **Risk**: Template system becomes too complex
  - **Mitigation**: Start with core genres, expand based on user feedback

---

## üìù Notes for Developer
- Templates should inspire, not constrain creativity
- Focus on storytelling craft, not prescriptive formulas
- Make all guidance optional and dismissible
- Consider cultural differences in story structure
- Plan for user-generated templates in future sprints
- Ensure templates work well across different act structures
