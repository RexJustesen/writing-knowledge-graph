# Sprint 1: Enhanced Search & Quick Navigation
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Priority:** Immediate Win - Low Complexity, High Impact  
**Sprint Goal:** Implement global search functionality and keyboard shortcuts to dramatically improve navigation speed across projects and acts.

---

## üéØ Epic: Search & Navigation System
Transform the current basic navigation into a powerful, fast search-driven interface that allows writers to instantly find and jump to any story element across their entire workspace.

### Business Value
- **User Retention**: Reduce friction in daily workflow by 60%
- **Productivity**: Enable instant access to any story element without clicking through navigation
- **PRD Alignment**: Addresses core requirement for "rapid reference" and "never lose sight of story structure"

## üìã User Stories

### Story 1: Global Search Across All Projects
**As a** writer managing multiple story projects  
**I want** to search across all my projects from any screen  
**So that** I can quickly find characters, plot points, or scenes without remembering which project they're in

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Search input appears in header/toolbar on all screens
- [x] Search returns results from all projects user has access to
- [x] Results categorized by: Projects, Characters, Plot Points, Scenes, Acts
- [x] Clicking result navigates directly to that element (opens project if needed)
- [x] Search is case-insensitive and supports partial matching
- [x] Recent searches are remembered (last 10)
- [x] Search works with minimum 2 characters typed

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// New SearchService class needed
interface SearchResult {
  id: string;
  type: 'project' | 'character' | 'plotpoint' | 'scene' | 'act';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  projectId: string;
  projectName: string;
  actId?: string;
  actName?: string;
}

// Add to existing api.ts
const searchAllProjects = async (query: string): Promise<SearchResult[]>
```

#### UI Components Needed
- `GlobalSearchBar.tsx` - Header search input
- `SearchResultsDropdown.tsx` - Dropdown results list
- `SearchResultItem.tsx` - Individual result with icon and navigation

#### Definition of Done
- [x] Search input visible on homepage and project workspace
- [x] Returns results within 500ms for typical query
- [x] Navigates correctly to found elements
- [x] Works across all user's projects
- [x] Mobile responsive design

- [x] `Ctrl/Cmd + 5` switches to Act V (if exists)
- [x] Shortcuts work when focus is anywhere in the application
- [x] Visual indicator shows current act clearly
- [x] Help tooltip shows available shortcuts

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Add to ProjectWorkspace.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyboard = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if ((e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) && e.key >= '1' && e.key <= '5') {
      const actNumber = parseInt(e.key);
      switchToAct(actNumber);
    }
  };
  
  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyboard);
  return () => document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyboard);
}, []);
```

#### Definition of Done
- [x] All shortcuts work consistently
- [x] No conflicts with browser shortcuts

const QuickNavPalette = () => {
  // Implementation with fuzzy search
  // Recent items tracking
  // Keyboard navigation
}
```

#### Definition of Done
- [x] Command palette opens/closes smoothly
- [x] Filtering works in real-time
- [x] Navigation is keyboard-accessible
- [x] Shows relevant context (act, character type, etc.)
- [x] Performance handles 100+ items smoothly

### Story 4: Recent Items Sidebar
**As a** writer jumping between different story elements  
**I want** to see my recently accessed items
