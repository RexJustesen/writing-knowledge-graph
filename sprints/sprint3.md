## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Progress tracking feels like pressure instead of motivation
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on encouragement, allow goal adjustment, provide grace periods
- **Risk**: Analytics become more important than actual writing
  - **Mitigation**: Keep analytics secondary to writing interface, emphasize writing quality over quantity
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large amounts of historical data
  - **Mitigation**: Implement efficient data aggregation, caching, and pagination

## 📝 Notes for Developer
- Emphasize encouragement over criticism in all messaging
- Make progress tracking opt-in where possible
- Focus on meaningful metrics that correlate with writing success
- Consider different writer types (daily vs. binge writers)
- Ensure privacy - some writers prefer private progress
- Plan for offline usage - cache progress locally when possible
- Design for motivation without creating pressure or anxiety
