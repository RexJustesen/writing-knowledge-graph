## üéØ Strategic Rationale

### **Why This Order?**

1. **User Retention Focus**: Sprints 1-3 address immediate friction points that cause user abandonment
2. **Foundation Building**: Sprints 4-6 enhance the core value proposition of visual story development
3. **Market Differentiation**: Sprints 7-8 introduce unique capabilities not found in competing tools

### **Risk Management**
- **Early Wins**: Quick improvements build user confidence and validate development approach
- **Incremental Complexity**: Each phase builds on previous capabilities, reducing integration risks
- **User Feedback Integration**: Each sprint includes validation points for course correction
